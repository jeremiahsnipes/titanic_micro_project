# ANA500 Micro Project 4 – Titanic Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.  
Two models were built:
- Dense Neural Network (feed-forward)
- LSTM Network (recurrent)

## Tools Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  

## Dataset
Features: Age, Fare, Pclass, SibSp, Parch  
Target: Survived  
Dataset: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Results
- Dense NN: ~72% accuracy  
- LSTM: ~65% accuracy, AUC ~0.73  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run all cells: "Snipes_Micro-Project 4_Machine_Learning_Project_2_of_2.ipynb"
